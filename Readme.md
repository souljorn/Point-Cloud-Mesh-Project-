#### Introduction, overview, and project academic motivations

> Our project is an attempt in the implementation of the first phase of Hugues Hoppe’s PhD thesis. The publication lays out a  > generalized approach to the generation of a piecewise linear surface, consisting of triangular faces pasted together along 
> their edges, from a set of unstructured points that are assumed to lie on or near an unknown surface. Starting in 1992 with > the publication of the seminal paper, then the complete thesis published in 1994, Hoppe’s work was pivotal to the  
> development of this particular area of research. Most of the ulterior advances, somehow, still rely on some of his 
> fundamental mechanisms.
